Think about different concerns
Think about axes and grouping of boxes separately

We're going to have an area in which to draw
A number of buckets we want to draw
Some sort of size of bounding boxes
Width is probably the same for all columns

Therefore, a column is given a list of boxes
Also column has a direction (will have to go up infinitely, no max height)

A function above that will iterate over the groups
 - position each group 
 - determine each group's Width

Make drawing library independent of systems
A system can call the drawing library functions

Make the Layouter independent of canvas
receives a list of bounding boxes and returns a list of rectangles
  - each rectangle has a position, width and height
  - further down, we have a function which draws these things

You're returning json which returns positions
You want transform/group to be one of your shapes, 
so you can tranform a group of boxes to its position on the x axis
